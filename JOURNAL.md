# QuadCooler Day 1 7/14/2025
## Initial Ideas
I started off by designing a laptop cooler that would be exhaust only, and would not add any thickness to the laptop. I knew I wanted it to be low profile, but I was not 100% sure how I would exactly accomplish this. I began by adding the fans to be flush with the rear, but I started to realize that this design would probably not be the most effective for cooling.

## Some Refinement
I ended up swapping from this original design to one that would have both an intake and exhaust fan, and I knew that I wanted to keep it low profile, so I went with a design that would have the intake fans on bottom be directly up against the bottom of the laptop. I also decided to angle the exhaust fans to be at 45 degree angles on the sides to allow for balanced exhaust that would also have shorter air paths. This design would allow for more performance, and better overall cooling. I also used CFD to ensure that these fluid paths were efficient, allowing for better travel of the air.

I added a bottom pan to bridge the two sides together, allowing for more structural rigidity along with allowing for a convent place to add the wiring.

I created the BOM, which required some research for components, and the Github Repository.
